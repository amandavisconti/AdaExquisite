# Ada Exquisite

The strings swell, the camera pans away--Ada Lovelace is pronounced dead.

As the echo of the tinny voice fades from the room, Ada lurches toward the phonograph to rip its wires from the still-humming Jacquard loom.

The sudden gloom of silence, the quick lack of hiss & hum, erode to swing the doors widening to the undertones of the room: a trill of a cardinal a yard away, an exhale of a floorboard

The invited journalists exhale as one.

Ralph pulls nervously his stocking up.

This stocking, he thinks: I'll be d---ed if it's the thing that gives me away.

Babbage still lives. The cylinder spins-- -- --its wheel back to Babylon, forward

The machine: is ready.
