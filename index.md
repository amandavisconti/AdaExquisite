title: Ada Exquisite
---
The strings swell, the camera pans away\--Ada Lovelace is pronounced dead.  
As the echo of the tinny voice fades from the room, Ada lurches  
toward the phonograph  
to rip its wires from the still-humming Jacquard loom.  
The sudden gloom of silence, the quick lack of hiss & hum,   
erode to swing the doors  
widening to the undertones of the room:  
a trill of a cardinal a yard away,  
an exhale of a floorboard 
The invited journalists exhale as one. 

Ralph pulls nervously his stocking up.  
This stocking, he thinks: I'll be d\---ed if it's the thing that gives me away.  

Babbage still lives. The cylinder spins\-- \-- \--its wheel back to Babylon, forward. 
The machine: is ready.  

Dickens' book falls open.  The page reads "Secret Intelligence".  

"This page is arrayed with typographic elegance,"  
Ralph declares.  The page does not respond.  It has already said. 
That tongue and mouth and teeth are dead. The machine. 
cares not a bit. It stretches, yawns. It stands. 
sturdily, awaiting to be born.  

The strings of the loom swell, warp and weft.
